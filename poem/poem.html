    <h1>Tell me, Muse</h1>

    <p>the story of that resourceful man who was driven to wander far and wide after he had sacked the holy citadel of Troy. 
    He saw the cities of many people and he learnt their ways. He suffered great anguish on the high seas in his struggles to preserve 
    his life and bring his comrades home. But he failed to save those comrades, in spite of all his efforts. 
    It was their own transgression that brought them to their doom, for in their folly they devoured the oxen of Hyperion 
    the Sun-god and he saw to it that they would never return. Tell us this story, goddess daughter of Zeus, beginning at whatever

    Father of men and gods opened a discussion among them. He had been thinking of the handsome Aegisthus,
